    <h1>Only The Platform</h1>
    <p>
      This website is an exploration of some neat features available on the
      modern web, inspired by the call to #usetheplatform. It only uses what
      browsers ship out of the box. [No dependencies](link to package.json)â€”just
      vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a simple Node.js HTTP server. Open
      source is awesome, and I've missed many libraries while tinkering here,
      but it is a lot of fun to experiment using only
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_platform">the platform</a>. If
      you're interested, [I wrote more about it here](link to blog).
